                <h3>HOW WE MET</h3>
                <p>Dan and Jen began talking by accident, really. In late 2008 Jen was living in Encinitas, while Dan was living in Pacific Beach (brah!). Jen moved away to live in Europe just as Dan moved up to Encinitas where he fell into the same group of friends as Jen, just missing her.</p>
                <p>A couple of years later Dan mistook Jen (who was then living in South Carolina) for a high school friend on Facebook and sent her a friend request.  She accepted, noticing that they had so many mutual friends in California. A short time after that, without any further contact, Dan posted his voice-over demo on Facebook. Jen was impressed by it and this got the two talking.</p>
                <p>After several months of chatting, emailing and trips between South Carolina and California, they decided to take a chance to see where things would go. Jen made the move back to San Diego where she moved in with a couple of mutual friends. Right next door to Dan.</p>
                <p>On their two-year anniversary, Dan proposed. Things couldn't have worked out any better â€¦ now they're gettin' hitched!</p>
