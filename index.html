                    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                    <p>Dan and Jen began talking by accident, really. One day back in January of 2011, Dan was on Facebook and noticed Jen pop up in the "People You May Know" section. They had both lived in Encinitas at separate times and fell into the same group of friends. Jen had moved away to Europe and at around the same time Dan started coming around, just missing each other.</p>
                    <p>Without a clear picture of Jen on her private Facebook profile and having a very similar name to someone Dan went to high school with, he sent Jen a friend request. All along thinking this was an old high school friend. She accepted, thinking with so many mutual friends they may actually know each other. A short time after that, Dan had posted his character demo on Facebook and Jen commented on it, "This is really good. Have we met?". This caused Dan some confusion, as he still believed that she was an aquaintance from high school. Having not really looked at it before, he checked out her profile and quickly realized that the two had never met. He then sent her a direct message explaining how he had mistakenly sent her a friend request, thinking she was someone else. Jen did not buy the story (until later confirmed by other friends) and the two began to go back and forth.</p>
                    <p>At the time, Jen was in South Carolina and Dan was in San Diego. Neither of the two were actively seeking out a relationship and there was a lot of uncertainty as to where this would all go, considering the 3000 miles between them. The two just kept talking with no great expectations and a couple months later, Jen took a trip to San Diego to visit friends. They finally met in person and hit it off right away. After about 6 months of long-distance, Jen decided to make the move back to San Diego in with a couple mutual friends. Next door to Dan. Obviously, it couldn't have worked out any better!</p>
