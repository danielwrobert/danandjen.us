                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                <h3>How We Met</h3>
                <p>Dan and Jen began talking by accident, really.</p>
                <p>First, a quick back story: In late 2008 Jen was living in Encinitas, while Dan was living in Pacific Beach (brah!). Jen moved away to live in Europe just as Dan moved up to Encinitas where he fell into the same group of friends as Jen, just missing her.</p>
                <p>Fast forward a couple of years later to one random day in January of 2011: Dan was checking in on Facebook where he noticed Jen pop up in the "People You May Know" section. With her having a very similar name to someone Dan went to high school with, he sent Jen a friend request mistaking her for an old high school acquaintance. Unsure, she accepted thinking with so many mutual friends in California they may actually know each other. A short time after that without any further contact, Dan posted his voice-over demo on Facebook. This intrigued Jen. After listening to the demo, Jen was impressed (and also insanely jealous that she does not have this talent!). Still unsure if they really knew each other she commented on the post saying, "This is great! Have we met?". Jen's comment caused Dan some confusion, as he still believed that she was an acquaintance from high school. Having not really looked at her profile before that day, he checked it out and quickly realized that the two had never met. He then sent her a direct message explaining how he had mistakenly sent her a friend request, thinking she was someone else. Jen did not buy the story (until later confirmed by other friends), but the two continued to communicate realizing they had a lot in common.</p>
                <p>At the time, Jen was living in South Carolina and Dan was in San Diego. Neither of the two were actively seeking out a relationship, but a mutual interest was developing. There was a lot of uncertainty as to where things would go considering the 3000 miles between them. Regardless, Dan and Jen continued chatting and Skyping. Several months later, Jen took a trip to San Diego to visit friends. They finally met in person and hit it off right away. After about a year of long-distance communication and several trips back and forth, they decided to take a chance to see where things would go. Jen made the move back to San Diego where she moved in with a couple of mutual friends. Right next door to Dan. Aware that being next-door neighbors could have been disastrous if things didn't work out, they were willing to take the chance. Both felt at peace about the initial decision and it couldn't have worked out any better!  Now they're gettin' hitched!</p>

                <h2>WEDDING DETAILS</h2>
                <h3>Ceremony &amp; Reception</h3>
                <p>Both the wedding ceremony and reception will be held at the San Diego Botanic Garden in Encinitas. The ceremony will begin at 4:00pm in the Walled Garden. Cocktail hour at the reception will start after the ceremony around 4:45ish. Dinner and Moonshining will begin shortly after.</p>
                <p>Early fall in San Diego is still typically pretty mild (mid 60s), but could get chilly once the sun goes down. As both the ceremony and the reception will be outside, be sure to bring a sweater or light jacket for the potential lower evening temperatures.</p>

                <h3>Travel</h3>
                <p>The closest airport is San Diego International Airport located in downtown San Diego. Encinitas is approximately 25 minutes North of the airport.
